            <h2>Today's Pick</h2>
            <h3>Björk - <i>Biophilia</i></h3>
            <img src="images/v-02.jpg" alt="Melvins a walk with love and death vynil cover">
            <p>
            Björk composed it as a concept album during the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis, exploring the links between nature, music and technology. Billed as the first "app album", Biophilia is a multimedia project released alongside a series of apps linking the album's themes to musicology concepts. It was followed by a series of educational workshops in four continents.
            </p>

            <p>Biophilia received critical acclaim and was named one of the best albums of 2011 by several publications; it was nominated for two awards at the 55th Grammy Awards in 2013, winning ‘Best Recording Package’. It debuted in the top 40 of every chart it entered worldwide, topping the Taiwan chart and peaking in the top 5 in Iceland, France and Denmark. In 2014, Biophilia became the first app included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
            </p>    
            
            <p>Biophilia grew from Björk's interest in nature and concerns about the environment. In June 2008, she performed a concert with the Icelandic band Sigur Rós to raise awareness about the use of Iceland's natural resources in aluminium melting plants. She founded the Náttúra organisation to promote Icelandic nature and grassroots industries.
            </p>    
            <p>New musical instruments were specially developed for the album. The Tesla coil was used as a musical instrument on the song ‘Thunderbolt’. The ‘gameleste’, a mixture between a gamelan and a celesta which was programmed in order to be played remotely by a tablet computer, was used in ‘Crystalline’ and ‘Virus’. A group of pendulums were put together, creating patterns with their moves, transmitting the movements of the Earth to the sound of a harp, making the song ‘Solstice’.

            <h2>Yesterday's Pick</h2>
            <h3>Melvins - A Walk With Love & Death</h3>
            <img src="images/v-01.jpg" alt="Melvins a walk with love and death vynil cover">
            <p>Melvins have announced a new double album via Ipecac Recordings. Dubbed A Walk With Love and Death, it will include the score to a short film of the same name that the band produced, Pitchfork reports.
            </p>
            <p>The two-part set will be released via CD, vinyl and digitally. It includes Death, which is a full LP, and Love, which comprises the film score for the Jesse Nieminen-directed short film. A release date has not been set for the film, but Ipecac unveiled a trippy, ominous trailer.
            </p>    
            <p>“This was a huge undertaking,” frontman Buzz Osborne wrote in the trailer’s accompanying post. “All three things: the album, the soundtrack and the film are benchmarks for us.”
            </p>    
            <p>Self-produced by the band with engineer Toshi Kasai, A Walk With Love and Death will feature guest Le Butcherettes’ Teri Gender Bender, who’s also a member of Osborne and drummer Dale Crover’s supergroup Crystal Fairy. Other guests include Pixies’ Joey Santiago and That Dog’s Anna Waronker.
            </p>    
            <p>“A Walk With Love and Death is one giant, dark, moody, psychotic head trip! Not for the faint of heart,” Crover added in the trailer post. “You’ll sleep with the lights on after listening.”
